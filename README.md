# cryptography
Updates on a custom cryptography algorithm developed from the ground up.

I have no prior knowledge on the topic of cryptography, but I wanted to get my hands on it. 
So, I created a custom encryption method in C (and eventually in Python), which is the progarmming language 
I'm most familiar with. I might add other iterations in different languages in the future.

In the meantime, you can find the article that explains the thought process behind this project here:
